# WeatherBeeApp
This is our project for the American University of Paris Software Engineering Class, named WeatherBee.

# Motivation 
- Beekeeping is a delicate art that is essential for sustaining food production for the world
- Bees are a temperamental creature whose cooperation with the beekeeper operates closely with the weather 
- Minimizing the educational barrier to entry of understanding when to interact and assist hives can increase novice beekeepersâ€™ success and hive retention rates
- A poorly managed hive leads to swarms and CCD

# About our Software
We seek to create a piece of scheduling software that advises beekeepers when to tend hives based on the weekly weather forecast and strength of their hive based on the user inputs
Location, current strength of hive, goals of the hive
